LITI-INJECTION-BUNCH                              selects in which bunch of the storage ring the first bunch of the pulse is to be injected: 0-867
LITI-EGUN-ENABLED                                 enable or disable the electron gun trigger: (0) disable | (1) enable
LITI-EGUN-DELAY                                   linac delay with respect to global clock [seconds]
LITI-CYCLE                                        enable injection procedure: (<>0) starts

LIFK-SAVEFLATFILE                                 when set to <>0 saves state of the model to an ASCII flatfile
