Standarlization of Process Variable (PV) Naming

1.  PV names should be composed of three substrings:

    <device>:<group>:<record>

    1-01 - <device> device name substring

    This first substring of the PV name defines the device name associated with the PV.
    It should follow the naming system defined in the Sirius wiki pages.

    1-02 - <group> substring

    Various PVs associated with a particular device can generally be grouped in categories or
    functions. For example, SIPS-CH-01C1:SIGNALGENERATOR:WAVEFORMTYPE.

    1-03 - <record> substring

    This substring should name a specific EPICS record.


2.  General Guidelines

    These are general guidelines to be used in naming PVs whenever possible:

    2-01 - all letters should be capitalized
    2-02 - words in PV names should either not be separated or be separated with the hyphen character.
 

3.  Common Name Shortcuts

    These name shortcuts should be adopted when the case applies

    3-01  :RB   - readback
    3-02  :SP   - setpoint
    3-03  :AVG  - average
    3-04  :STD  - standard deviation
    3-05  :RMS  - root mean square
    3-06  :NUM  - number
    3-07  :INJ  - injection
    3-08  :EJE  - ejection
    3-09  :INC  - increment
    3-10  :DEC  - decrement
    3-11  :H    - horizontal
    3-12  :V    - vertical
    3-13  :DIPK - dipolar kicker
    3-14  :NLK  - non-linear kicker


4.  Common Names

    These common names should be used whenever possible

    4-01  :ENABLED - 'True' | 'False'
    4-02  :DELAY   - time value
